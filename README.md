## "Amino Master" Game

### Introduction
The aim of this game is to help the begginiers in science,
to learn the structures and the codes of protein aminoacids. 
When I started studying at university I struggled with learning all teh structures and codes of the aminoacids.
So, as a gift to others I decided to creat a simple game to overcome this difficulties. 

I hope someone will find it useful! ðŸ˜ƒ


### How to play :thinking:

1. First thing that occurs when you run the game is the introduction and short manual.
   At the left side of the window is the panel where player can choose the game mode.
   It can be either structure of amino acid, the one-letter code or three letter code.

2. After choosing the mode, player have to press the "Start game" button under the select bar.

3. Then the game begins. At the top, there is counter of current question (1).
Depending on mode, image of amino acid, one-letter code or three-letter code appears (2).
At the bottom, there is a bar to type the answer and submit button (3).

Example with three-letter code:

<img src="images/4.png" style="width:700px; height:630px" />

Example with one-letter code:

<img src="images/5.png" style="width:700px; height:630px" />

After answering the last question, the results table apears. It is a summary of answers for all the questions.
The answer is considered wheter the first letter is capital letter or not. 

The table consists of four columns:
- question
- answer of the player
- right answer
- results of the answer depending on corectness

Additionally, under the results table there is the total score.

And now player can again choose the mode and play again by clicking the button start the game.

And this is all about the game.

I hope you will enjoy it! :smiley:
